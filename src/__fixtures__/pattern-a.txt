# Concepts
Source: https://axiom.co/docs/ai-engineering/concepts

Learn about the core concepts in AI engineering: Capabilities, Collections, Evals, Scorers, Annotations, and User Feedback.

This page defines the core terms used in the AI engineering workflow. Understanding these concepts is the first step toward building robust and reliable generative AI capabilities.

## AI engineering lifecycle

The concepts in AI engineering are best understood within the context of the development lifecycle.

### Capability

A generative AI capability is a system that uses large language models to perform a specific task.

## What's next?

Now that you understand the core concepts, get started with the [Quickstart](/ai-engineering/quickstart).


# Create
Source: https://axiom.co/docs/ai-engineering/create

Build AI capabilities using any framework, with best support for TypeScript-based tools.

## Build your capability

Define your capability using your framework of choice:

```ts src/lib/capabilities/classify-ticket.ts
import { generateObject } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

// This comment has # symbols that should NOT trigger splits
// # Not a title
// Source: not a real source

export async function classifyTicket(input: { 
  subject?: string; 
  content: string 
}) {
  const result = await generateObject({
    model: openai('gpt-4o-mini'),
    messages: [
      {
        role: 'system',
        content: 'Classify support tickets as: question, bug_report, or feature_request.',
      },
    ],
  });
  return result.object;
}
```

## What's next?

Once you have a working capability, systematically evaluate its performance.


# Evaluation overview

Systematically measure and improve your AI capabilities through offline evaluation.

Evaluation is the systematic process of measuring how well your AI capability performs.
